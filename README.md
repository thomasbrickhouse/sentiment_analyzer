# Sentiment Analyzer

Sentiment analyzer is a command line program that determines the general attitude of a line of text. For example, 
when the program is given the sentence "That movie was fantastic," it would evaluate the sentence as positive.

The algorithm in this project assigns a numeric value to each word based on how positive or negative that word 
is and then scores the text as a whole based on the average sentiment value of the individual words. The values for 
each word are assigned via an extensive collection of movie reviews from the Rotten Tomatoes website.
Each review is associated with a number 0 - 4, 0 being negative and 4 being positive. Individual words will be scored 
by computing the average rating of all reviews containing that word.
